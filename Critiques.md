    - Happy with the final product.

    - How to work in a team development environment.
    - How to work with a developer team and also act as one.

    - How to use Postman.
    - How to use React.
    - How to use the gitlab CI.
- **What can we do better?**  
    - Communicate a little better with each other.
    - Add more data sources instead of just using Maps API.
- **What effect did the peer reviews have?**
    - They set a standard for us to work towards.
    - Reinforced parts of us that were good.
    - Led to self reflection.
- **What puzzles us?**  
    - Something we did not look at is how to add more data sources in one database. We only speculated doing that in the beginning.
    - Some of us were only exposed to mainly frontend, or mainly backend, so specifics on how the "otherside" works was left unclear.

# Dev Team Critique

## Reflection Questions
- **What did they do well?**  
    - I liked the asthetic of the site (good UI/Graphics). 
    - Great concept overall.
- **How effective was their RESTful API?**
    - Was very effective. Gave relevant information.
    - The data theyt had was kind of small, but that is because they had such a specific focus, which can make providing good data harder.
- **How well did they implement your user stories?** 
    - They implemented all of our user stories nicely! 
- **What did we learn from their website?** 
    - First generation students actually need these resources aggregated. It is a good project, and we were surprised that were isn't already something like this for UT. 
- **What can they do better?**  
    - Maybe add a filter to select scholarships for different groups.
- **What puzzles us about their website?**  
    - I think the "Tools Used" section on the about page needs to be updated.
    - How they got it to look so good.
